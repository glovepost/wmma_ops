/**
 * @brief Half-precision GEMM using WMMA with shared memory, shared double buffering,
 * warp tiling, cooperative loading, Hilbert-curve mapping, and vectorized global 512-bit (4 128-bit) loads/writes
 *
 * This kernel combines WMMA operations with shared memory, double buffering,
 * warp-level tiling and vectorized global loads. It uses double buffering at the shared
 * level to overlap computation with memory operations, maximizing hardware utilization and hiding
 * memory latency. Additionally, cooperative loading is used to load both A and B to shared memory
 * in parallel. The kernel also incorporates Hilbert-curve mapping for improved L2 cache locality.
 * This kernel also re-orders fragment loading to improve efficiency and uses
 * __launch_bounds__ to limit register pressure. -mcumode is also used to compile this kernel.
 * This kernel relies on buffer load/store instructions for better out-of-bounds access performance; if manual
 * boundary checking is enabled performance takes a hit (prefer wmma_opt_3 in such cases).
 *
 * @tparam K_TYPE The type of kernel, should be 'kernel_type::wmma_opt_2'
 * @param[out] C  Output matrix of size M × N
 * @param[in]  A  Input matrix A of size M × K (stored in column-major format)
 * @param[in]  B  Input matrix B of size K × N (stored in row-major format)
 * @param[in]  M  Number of rows in matrices A and C
 * @param[in]  N  Number of columns in matrices B and C
 * @param[in]  K  Number of columns in matrix A/rows in matrix B
    *
    * @note Implements double-buffering at global->shared
    * @note Each warp processes a 4×4 grid of 16×16 WMMA tiles
    * @note Uses shared memory tiles of size (block_m × block_k) for A and (block_k × block_n) for B
    * @note Employs a 4×4 warp grid configuration within each thread block
    * @note Uses Hilbert-curve mapping for improved cache locality
